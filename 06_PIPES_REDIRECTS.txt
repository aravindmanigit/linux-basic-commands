Using pipes ("|") we can combine several commands. Output of one command becomes input of another command

ls -l | less

cat {file name} | less -> displays a large file with less

ps -aux -> processes running on the system

ps -aux | less

cat {file name} | sort -r -> if file contains numbers it will sort in reverse order

cat {file name} | sort -r | less -> we can combine any number of commands

Redirects
---------

Redirect Output
---------------

The redirection output sign is ">"

It is used to redirect the output of command, script or program to another command, script or program as input.

ls -l > {file name} -> Tell to get the information from ls -l and save those information in a file.

ps -aux > {file name} 

Note :: ps -aux > {file name} will throw an error. In that case remove the "-" and execute as ps aux > {file name} 

Redirect Input
-------------

The redirection output sign is "<"


It is used to redirect the input of command, script or program to another command, script or program as output

sort < {file name} -> Takes the input from file to the command
