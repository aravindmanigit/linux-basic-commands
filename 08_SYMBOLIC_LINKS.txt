Soft Links and Hard Links
-------------------------

Soft Links
----------

ln -s /home/shared/access_log access_soft -> creates a short cut of access_log file from location /home/shared/ and the short cut is named as 
					     access_soft. The short cut will be created in pwd.

stat access_soft -> gives the stats about the short cut. It will be stated that it is symbolic link. The permission will be 777

if the name of the original file then the symbolic link will not work.

mv /home/shared/access_log /home/shared/access_log_old

The symbolic link will appear in red when listed.

If we again change the name of the linked file to its original name then symbolic link / shaortcut will work.

mv /home/shared/access_log_old /home/shared/access_log

it will now work and it can be checked by

cat access_soft | less (Note :: press q to quit out of less)

Hard Links
----------

ln /home/shared/access_log accessshared -> link will not created and the directory size is same as that of original directory.
					   The permissions also will be same as that of original file.

stat accesshard -> gives the stat about the accesshard. It will be stated that it is regular file. The permission will be same as that of original file (e.g 0644)


cat accesshard | less

If we change the permission of the hard link file, the permission in the original file will also change

chmod 600 accesshard

Now check the original file permission. It will also be as same as hard link file. 

If we change the permission of original file the hard link permission will also change accordingly.

chmod 644 /home/shared/access_log

Check the hard link, it will also be the same.


If the original file is changed or renamed or moved location, then the hard link will not be affected as because as the hard link directly
refers to the file in the hard disk location.

mv /home/shared/access_log /home/shared/access_log_old

Now check the hard link / shortcut. Try to access the hard link it will work normally

cat accesshard | less

Note :: If we want to create a hard link both original file and hard link / shortcut should present in the same harddisk. otherwise it will not work.
