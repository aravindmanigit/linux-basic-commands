-rw-r--r-- -> total 10 bits

e.g -rw-r--r-- aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group)    0 MAR 23 09:35 test.txt
    drw-r--r-- aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group) 4096 MAR 23 09:35 testdir

- -> first bit if it is '-' means it is a file and if first bit is 'd' it mans it is a directory
rw- -> first 3 bits are the permission for the owner
r-- -> the second 3 bits are the permission for the group
r-- -> the last 3 bits are the permission for any other user on the system

r denotes read and has octal number 4
w denotes write and has octal number 2
x denotes execute and has octal number 1

take -rw-r--r-- aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group)    0 MAR 23 09:35 test.txt for example

This denotes the user aravind has read and write rights, the group aravind can only read this file, the other users only have the read permission.

take -rw-r--r-- aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group)    0 MAR 23 09:35 test.txt for example

For calculating the octal number, the user aravind has the octal number of 6 ie r = 4, w = 2 and no execute permission. So it is 6 for the user aravind
Similarly the octal number for group will be 4 since it has only read =4 the write and execute are 0. In this case it is 4+0+0 = 4.
Finally the octal number for other users in this system is also 4

so all together the permission is 644 for the file test.txt.

Another example to calculate the permission,

drwxr-xr-x aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group) 4096 MAR 23 09:35 testdir

So the permission for the directory named testdir will be 755

so the default permission for a file created will have 644 and the defualt permission for a directory will be 755

To switch user
--------------

su dev -> change to normal user

su - -> change to root
Password:

To CHECK current user
---------------------

whoami -> dev

Now try to edit the text.txt with user dev. Since only read permission is given for other users in the system, it will not allow to edit

vi test.txt -> try to edit and a W10 Warning message is dipslayed at the bottom as readonly file.
try to save the file after modifying error message is displayed as E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)


To change the permission of file or directory
---------------------------------------------

chmod 646 test.txt

This may throw error if the permission is changed by another user as operation not permitted.

su aravind
Password:

Now issue the chmod 646 test.txt

ls -l
-rw-r--rw- aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group)    0 MAR 23 09:35 test.txt

Now switch back to user dev
Edit and save the same file. It will successfully save the file.

Note :: If the directory is created by a user, the permission will be 700 for e.g

drwx------ aravind(this is user) aravind(this is group)    0 MAR 23 09:35 testdir

if we try to open a directory created by other users, then the error message thrown will be
ls -l dev/
ls: cannot open directory dev/: permission denied

if we want user dev to access the file test.txt which was created by user aravind and have a permission 644, then 
we will give the permission as 664 and add the user dev to the group aravind belongs to.

for e.g chmod 664 test.txt
su -
password:
useradd -aG aravind dev -> aravind is group of aravind and dev is the user name.

su dev
groups -> displays the group user belongs to
vi test.txt
edit and change the file contents. It will be successful in this case.

To change the owner of file o directory
---------------------------------------

chown -R {new owner user id} {name of the file to be change the ownership}

chown -R hari text.txt -> this may throw error if the current user is not the owner of the file.
su -
password:
chown -R hari text.txt
check with ls -l

To change the group of the file or directory
--------------------------------------------

chown -R :{new group name} {name of the file or directory}

chown -R :newgroup test.txt
check with ls -l
