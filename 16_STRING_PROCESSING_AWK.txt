awk command is similar to grep command.

awk '{print $0}' {file name} | less -> displays all the lines in a file similarly to cat command.

grep " 200" log.txt | less -> displays the whole line but it is not possible to get a particular field. The field is usually separated by a single space.

awk '{print $9}' log.txt | less -> this will print all the information in field 9 

awk '{print $0, $9}' log.txt | less -> we can combine the fields together.

awk '{print $0, "---", $9}' log.txt | less -> we can introduce chars between the fields that are been displayed.

awk '/word to search/ {print $0}' log.txt | less -> we can search the contents that contains the word to search

awk '$7=="/word to search" {print $1}' log.txt | less -> we can search if a particular field contains the word to search.

awk '$9==500 {print $0}' log.txt | less

ps -ef | awk '{print $1,$8}' | less

ps -ef | awk '$1=="postfix" {print $1,$8}' | less
